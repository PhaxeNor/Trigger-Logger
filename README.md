Trigger Logger is a Unity Editor script that will give you a list of all your VRC_Triggers.
It will give you information about each game object that has a VRC_Trigger on it.

This was created so that you could get a better overview over your triggers.

### Current Features
- List over triggers
- Stats (Total triggers, broadcasts and actions)
- Filtering (Triggers, broadcast, actions and SendRPC)
- Toggle what you want to see (Prefabs, empty triggers, errors/warnings)

Support and help is done via Discord, Twitter or Github.

### Notes
A bug in the filtering that I haven't been able to figure out yet is when you select the first type the last one will also be selected.
This isn't something that will prevent it from working, you just got to be aware of it.
